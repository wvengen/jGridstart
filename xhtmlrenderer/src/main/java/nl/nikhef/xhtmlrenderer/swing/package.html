Provides an HTML component based on <a href="https://code.google.com/p/flying-saucer/">xhtmlrenderer</a>'s
{@link org.xhtmlrenderer.swing.XHTMLPanel}. Several features are added, as described in
{@link nl.nikhef.xhtmlrenderer.swing.TemplatePanel}, which is
the most important class; the others are mostly helpers.
<p>
If you are just looking for simple template functionality based on {@link org.w3c.dom.Document},
you might find {@link nl.nikhef.xhtmlrenderer.swing.TemplateDocument} interesting as well.
