Core jGridstart functionality regarding {@code .globus}-type certificates.
This is where the actual work regarding certificates happens.
<p>
jGridstart works with {@code .globus}-type certificate directories and each
is represented by a {@link nl.nikhef.jgridstart.CertificatePair CertificatePair}.
Together they form a {@link nl.nikhef.jgridstart.CertificateStore CertificateStore}
or {@link nl.nikhef.jgridstart.CertificateStoreWithDefault CertificateStoreWithDefault}.
At several places, certificate directories are verified to be consistent using
{@link nl.nikhef.jgridstart.CertificateCheck CertificateCheck}.
<p>
{@link nl.nikhef.jgridstart.CertificateRequest CertificateRequest} contains
some methods to handle new requests. It parses and creates certificate subjects
from pieces of information, and knows about password policies. One such piece
of information is the organisation a user belongs to. This is handled in the
separate class {@link nl.nikhef.jgridstart.Organisation Organisation}.
