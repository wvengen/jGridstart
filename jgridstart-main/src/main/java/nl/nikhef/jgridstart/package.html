Core jGridstart functionality regarding {@code .globus}-type certificates.
This is where the actual work regarding certificates happens.
<p>
jGridstart works with {@code .globus}-type certificate directories and each
is represented by a {@link CertificatePair}. Together they form a
{@link CertificateStore} or {@link CertificateStoreWithDefault}. At several places,
certificate directories are verified to be consistent using {@link CertificateCheck}.
<p>
{@link CertificateRequest} contains some methods to handle new requests. It
parses and creates certificate subjects from pieces of information, and knows
about password policies. One such piece of information is the organisation a
user belongs to. This is handled in the separate class {@link Organisation}.
