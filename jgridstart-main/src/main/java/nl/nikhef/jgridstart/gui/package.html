Graphical user-interface
<p>
The {@link nl.nikhef.jgridstart.gui.Main Main} program creates the main window
{@link nl.nikhef.jgridstart.gui.JGSFrame JGSFrame}, containing a
{@link nl.nikhef.jgridstart.gui.ComponentCertificateList ComponentCertificateList}
showing the available certificates, and a
{@link nl.nikhef.xhtmlrenderer.swing.TemplatePanel TemplatePanel} with certificate
details; the latter contains one of the html files present in this package.
<p>
Menu and shortcuts are populated by children of {@link javax.swing.Action Action}s.
Some of these work on the currently selected certificate (which is kept track of
by {@link nl.nikhef.jgridstart.gui.util.CertificateSelection CertificateSelection}),
and these actions are children of {@link nl.nikhef.jgridstart.gui.CertificateAction CertificateAction}.
