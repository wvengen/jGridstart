/** Interface for communicating with an (online) Certificate Authority (CA)
 * <p>
 * This interface provides an abstraction layer to access a certificate authority.
 * It is up to each implementation to use the arguments available.
 * <p>
 * A certificate signing request is generated by the caller, and then passed
 * to either {@link #encodeCertificationRequest} or {@link #signCertificationRequest}.
 * The return value must be stored by the caller, and is to be supplied to
 * {@link #uploadCertificationRequest}. Then the caller can poll to see if the
 * CA has finished the request using {@link #isCertificationRequestProcessed},
 * and if that is the case the certificate can be retrieved using
 * {@link #downloadCertificate}.
 * <p>
 * The reason for the split between encoding/signing and uploading is to allow for
 * certificate renewals that are signed by the existing key. The key must be decoded
 * when the renewal request is generated (for signing it), and that may require
 * user interaction. To minimise user interaction, the request is generated separately
 * from the uploading.
 * <p>
 * To each method is supplied a {@linkplain Properties} object, which contains
 * information that can be used by the implementation to create and submit a
 * request. Additionally, the implementation can use it to store properties.
 * When, for example, a certain part of the subject DN is needed for submission,
 * {@linkplain #encodeCertificationRequest} could set a property based on the
 * request object, so that {@linkplain #uploadCertificationRequest} can easily
 * retrieve it.
 * <p>
 * TODO indicate namespace for properties
 * <p>
 * CA parameters (like URLs and settings) should be retrieved from the
 * {@link System#getProperty system properties} in the {@literal jgridstart.ca} namespace.
 * Any URLs or fragments thereof should be put in the {@literal jgridstart.ca.base} namespace.
 * Please look at existing implementations for reuse of properties. When a property is not
 * defined, each implementation must set a sensible default and also update the system property
 * to reflect that.
 * <p>
 * If you are creating a new implementation and find that the current interface
 * provides insufficient information, please contact the developers, and we'll
 * see if an API update is sensible.
